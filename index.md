<br/><br/>[![Download](macOS/DownloadOnTheMacAppStore.svg)](macappstores://itunes.apple.com/app/id1378587993)


## Buy
First of all, the purchase schema that SQLiteFlow uses is **one-time purchase then own it life time**. 

Please note that there's **no subscription purchase schema in our app**. It's kind of very annoying that people immediately assume that there is and give us a one-star along with some very unpleasant words in App Store.

Here's how purchase work in SQLiteFlow.
1. **Pay $0 to get a one-time in-app purchase "2-week Trial" which is a 2-week trial license.**
After trial ends, no automatically renews would happen, however SQLiteFlow will be locked and you will no longer have permission to use this app unless:
2. **Pay $xxx to get a one-time in-app purchase "Full App" which is a life time license.** After you get the left time license, you own the app life time.
3. If you still has any question about it, please contact us through <a href="https://github.com/SQLiteFlow/SQLiteFlow-Issues/issues" target="_blank">creating an issue</a> instead of giving us a one-star instantly in App Store, we're really appreciate it.
